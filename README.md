This github contains the data and code from online experiments ran on two paradigms (Warmth & Compentence and Circles) required to produce:
1. Empirical peak-shift effect in choices of participants
2. Aggregate choice probabilities as given by a rational inattention models with 3 different cost functions: mutual information, neighborhood-based and LLR.

Please see extended readme on experimental design, data structure and code estimation in the attached readme file.
